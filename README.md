## COVID-19 Tracker

This app provides real-time COVID-19 statistics by country, allowing users to track confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and critical data globally.
Using the RapidAPI COVID-19 Data API, the app fetches the latest information and presents it in an easy-to-read format.
Users can select a country from a dropdown, and the app dynamically updates the displayed stats for the selected location.
